# Multi-view Wire Art
This is the C++ implementation of the paper [Multi-view Wire Art (SIGGRAPH Asia 2018)](https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/download/file?guid=3d4d4ee9-cdec-11e8-9b71-0011328fa92e) 

## Introduction
Wire art is the creation of 3D sculptural art using wire strands. As the 2D projection of a 3D wire sculpture forms line drawing patterns, it is possible to craft multi-view wire sculpture art â€” a static sculpture with multiple interpretations when perceived at different viewpoints. In this project, we present a computational framework for automatic creation of multi-view 3D wire sculpture. Our system takes two or three user-specified line drawings and the associated viewpoints as inputs and output 3D multi-view wire sculptures. For more detail please refer to our [Project Page](https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/projects/recreational_graphics/MVWA).

## Results
Our method handles inputs with varying complexity. More results and dynamic exhibition can be found in our [Online Gallery](https://cgv.cs.nthu.edu.tw/MVWA_onlinegallery/).
